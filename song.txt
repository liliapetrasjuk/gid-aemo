I'm off to save the world, like I'm some kind of Batman
I'm gonna make you see the power that is me
Uh-uh, it's what we do that defines us
Uh-uh-uh-uh, I'm doin' it all for you
Let me be your superhero
Let me be the one to hold you

Let me be your superhero, your dynamite
Let me be the one to hold you to do you right

We're living in a world with madness in the shadows
I'm here to keep you safe, protect you from the dark
Uh-uh, sometimes, I feel like a monster
Uh-uh-uh-uh, but I know what's best for you

Let me be your superhero, your dynamite
Let me be the one to hold you to do you right
Let me be your superhero, your dynamite
Let me be everything you need to feel alright

Anywhere you go, I'll follow
Hoping I could show I'm not the enemy
Wishing you would see that I am more than a stalker (Stalker)

Let me be your superhero, your dynamite
Let me be the one to hold you to do you right
Let me be your superhero, your dynamite
Let me be everything you need to feel alright

Let me be everything you need to feel alright
